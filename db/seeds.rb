# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
first = Coupon.create(coupon_code: "faskaeerunfds", store: "tenderloin")
second = Coupon.create(coupon_code:"jasdkj", store: "soma")
